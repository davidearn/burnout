The `burnout` package requires R â‰¥ 4.2.0 in order for the documentation to be displayed as desired.  As mentioned [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html), 4.2.0 automatically supports [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), which I use liberally in [roxygen](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) documentation.
